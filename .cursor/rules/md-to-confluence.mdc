- The linter flake8 has an enforcement of 100 chars lines, do not exceed 100 characters per line written.
- Use 3.10 Pythonista approaches to write your code
- When in doubt, run the linter flake8
- If you need to validate that a code is ready to be shipped after implementing any new feature, create a commit to the master branch in the local Git repo, this will trigger pre-commit and let you know if anything is wrong.
- If a file is bigger than 400 lines, split it.
- Keep the @tasks-list.md file up-to-date with whatever you do, also keep track of possible improvements
- Keep your explanations short, no need to over elaborate over things unless it is something complex that needs the data to be shown and mentioned. NO EMOJIS!
- Always implement a test for a feature first, run the test (it must fail), then implement the feature and run the test again (it MUST pass).
- Before suggesting something is complete, review the tests for such feature/bugfix and check that all tests pass.
- If this is a new chat/session, always check for the above rules.
